        This app is being powered by a number of small and large &lt;b&gt;open source projects&lt;/b&gt;
        which all together have made this project happen. We couldn\'t have done this without them.
        To those fellow developers out there spending their part time creating those libraries:
        you guys are awesome, keep on rocking!&lt;br&gt;
